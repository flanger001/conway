# Conway's Game Of Life

In this repo I explore some implementations of the Conway's Game Of Life algorithm in different languages.

Rules (rewritten for clarity):

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die.
4. All other dead cells stay dead.

Languages and implementation counts:

* **Ruby**: 1
* **Rust**: 2
